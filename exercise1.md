# Exercise 1

## CI Steps in Python

### Linting

There are multiple linting tools available for Python to ensure the code quality incuding Pylint and Flake8. These tools ensures code quality by enforcing PEP8 standards and analyzing potential errors.

### Testing

There are also many test runners available for Python including Pytest and Unittest. Unittest is the built in standard unit testing libary for Python. Pytest is a very popular library for testing. It offers various features such as parameterization and fixtures. It also allows comprehensive test coverage.

### Building

Python is interpreted language so it doesn't require a build process like compiled languages. Building in the context of CI/CD for Python often refers to packaging the application and its dependencies. Setuptools and wheel can be used for this purpose.

### CI Alternatives

Some other CI alternatives besides Jenkins and Github Actions include Travis CI, CircleCI, GitLab CI/CD and Azure DevOps.

### CI environment

Cloud-based solution would work better for this team. With only six members, the team is relatively small for a software project. Cloud-based solutions works well for small projects. When the application is already in development and is due to be released soon, the simple installation and deployment process of cloud computing is an advantage. Budget also plays a role in the choice. Cloud services are also generally cheaper for small projects. So the information needed to make a decision is at least team size and expertise, budget, project requirements and current infrastructure.
